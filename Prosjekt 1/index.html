      <h1>Klæbb kunst</h1>
      <p class="description">
        Klæbb kunst is the leading artist when it comes to abstract art. His
        mastery of complex shapes such as squares, rectangles, triangles and
        circles is unmatched. Under you can enjoy two different renditions of a
        classic art piece. Try to hover the sun for some excitement in life.

        <h2>Flexbox/grid</h2>
        <p class="description">
          In this project I've chosen to use flexbox to make the layout easier
          and more flexible. Since everything is displayed in a column this is
          mainly for making it easier to center elements etc. The reason I did
          not use grid was because the design didn't use multiple columns and
          rows so I could keep it simple. More direct the whole page has
          display: flex, flex-direction: column and align-items: center.
        </p>
        <h2>HTML canvas and SVG</h2>
        <p class="description">
          The first picture uses hardcoded SVG in html. I've used the rect and
          circle tags to make the different elements. To animate I use the
          animate tag with focus on the x-attribute on the "car". The duration
          is 10 seconds and changes from left to right.<br /><br />
          The second picture is me trying to remake the first in canvas. I have
          a canvas object and then the rest is done in javascript. I used
          fillRect() to make the rectangles and the circles are drawn using
          beginPath() and arc(). To animate I update an xOffset variable every
          time the function is called with small increment so that every time
          the canvas redraws we move the "car" by adding that small offset to
          the x value. To do the hover animation on the sun mousemove(e) on the
          canvas tag triggers checkSunHover() every time the mouse moves within
          the canvas element. Then we do some math to calculate if the mouse
          position is inside the radius of the circle (sun). If I could change
          one thing it is that the animation speed is just an estimate and not
          perfectly equal in both pictures.
        </p>
        <h2>JQuery</h2>
        <p class="description">
          JQuery is mainly used to implement the button that hides/shows the
          documentation. It simply checks if its clicked then sets display to
          either "block" or "none" in addition to changing the button text.
        </p>
        <h2>Cross-browser testing</h2>
        <p class="description">
          I've done manual cross-browser testing in chrome and firefox. This
          includes checking that the functionality works equally onboth sites
          and that the styling looks equal. I know that some css attributes work
          different in some browsers so this does not guarantee that it works on
          all browsers.

            For learning the basics of SVG, JQuery and Canvas I've used
            w3schools.com.

          For making the hover animation in canvas I used some code from
